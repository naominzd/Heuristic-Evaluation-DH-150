# UX Design for Community Learning - UCLA

### DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Naomi Deng

Motivation and Description of the Community: 

In this assignment, I choose to focus on the undergraduate student organizations at the University of California, Los Angeles, particularly by analyzing the official websites designed for two on-campus organizations: Sociology Undergraduate Association and OutWrite Magazine. As a member who has contributed to and worked with both organizations, I have close access to both websites. Through my personal experience as a frequent-user, I recognized several flaws and imperfections in their website designs that might lead to inconvenient and inefficient use of the website, which can further affect user experience, especially for novice users. A unpleasant user experience might influence the website traffic and cause obstacles for attracting new members for the organization. Therefore, through this exercise, I aim to recognize, detect and analyze both websites following Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems, as well as propose potential suggestions to create an improved overall experience for future users. 

The first website is the official website of Sociology Undergraduate Association at UCLA. Sociology Undergraduate Association at UCLA is an on-campus organization registered under Sociology department with a purpose of fostering community learning in the academia of Sociology. The website is hosted by executive members from the association, using the platform Weebly.

The second website is the website for an on-campus, student-run magazine called "OutWrite". OutWrite Magazine is an online media platform that instill power in the voices of queer community by sharing original editorial content, interviews and creative writing pieces on essential issues that matter. It aims to educate allies and advance communications within the community.

## 1: Visibility of system status

- The website does not always inform users about what is going on on the website. For example, when I first opened the gallery page, there is no indication of what kind of content is exhibited on the page, nor is there a loading sign of any graphic contents. I waited for a few minutes to make sure that the page is empty. A solution to the problem is to have written content such as “please check with us later, the page is still under development” to inform users that the gallery page is not fully updated. Severity Rating (3)

- No "page loading" indicators: when I am on the "Blog" page, the page shows 10 articles in total, whereas when loading, the website doesn’t indicate the process. Instead, it shows a black block which confuses users to understand which actions are being processed. The solution is to add a loading indication such as a percentage bar that shows the number of articles that the website is trying to load. Severity Rating (3)

## 2: Match between system and the real world 

- On the home page, there’s no introduction of the organization and thus first-time users who use the website might feel lost of what they are looking at. For example, on the homepage, there are only a random aesthetics picture, the title of the organization, and three buttons that link to the social media platforms of the organization (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram). Severity Rating (3)

- The “Join” page could be misleading to users. On the page, the website provides a mailing form which should be instead categorized as “Subscription” instead of “Join”. Additionally, on the top part, the website exhibits information for “Membership” which should be listed on a separate website because it serves for a different function (recruitment instead of collaboration). Severity Rating (2)

## 3: User control and freedom

- On the right top corner of the website, there is an email button. If someone accidentally clicked the email button, it links to the primary email application installed on each laptop. This causes trouble for users who click this button by mistake and the website does not provide a “undo” function. For example, I am using a Mac OS system and thus it automatically opened my “Email” application. There is no undo button that prevents the application from opening. Thus, I had to manually close my email application. Severity Rating (2)

- The subscription form has no "cancel" or "reset" button, which means that for users who enter the wrong information, they would have to manually delete the information instead of hitting a reset button that helps them “undo” their action. Additionally, for users who might have a second thought on submitting their contact information, there is no way to “undo” or “cancel” their submission. Severity Rating (2)

## 4: Consistency and standards

- The email button on the right top corner does not necessarily follow platform conventions. Conventionally, the contact and social media information are usually systematized together either on the header of the website or the foot bar. However, the website exhibits social media platforms through individual buttons on the homepage and separates the email button, which is positioned by itself. The email button should be exhibited using the same button design with the other social media buttons, and the home page should consist of an introduction of the organization. Severity Rating (3)

- There is a lack of “Contact Us,” “Privacy Policy” and social media icons on the foot bar. Usually, these links could be found on the bottom of the page (platform conventions). Severity Rating (2)

## 5: Error prevention

- The subscription form does not detect the errors in the email information users entered in the subscription form, and thus it does not prevent errors from occurring. This missing error prevention function could cause miscommunications and lost opportunities. For example, if a user accidentally wrote “gmail.com” and “fmail.com” and the website didn’t prevent this from happening (by a friendly warning pop-up sign or box), the organization could lose a potential member or target of interest. Severity Rating (3)

## 6: Recognition rather than recall

- When users enter the email address in the form on the "Join" page, the website fails to provide a preset of @gmail.com / @outlook.com /@yahoo.com, which could serve for email addresses recognition as well as error prevention. Severity Rating (2)

## 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

- The "Blog" page lacks individual links for each of the writing pieces and a “back to the top” option. This causes inconvenience for users who has a particular interest in a certain piece or wants to quickly go to another page. When viewing the Blog page, a user can only go through all the content listed on the page before he can choose to view another page (there are “previous” and “back” buttons provided only on the bottom of the page). Severity Rating (3). 

## 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

- The website contains a minimalist design which could be further improved by reducing irrelevant graphics and reconstructing the layout of certain pages. For example, the main visual cues used in the Blog page and the overall visual appearances consist of multiple colors, whereas on the Home page, there is a black and white picture which causes confusion and inconsistency use of hues. Additionally, the Blog page appears congested and poorly structured due to the size of the fonts used in each article and the spacing between each article. Severity Rating (1).

## 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

- Although the contact form on the "Join" page does recognize missing information, (example: there will be a reminder in case the user doesn’t provide his/her last name or email address, it explains the error in plain language as “Please correct the highlighted fields”), it does not help recognize or scrutinize errors entered manually by users in contact forms. For example, I intentionally entered an invalid email address (maggielee@jsdfksd.com), the website doesn’t not recognize the error in the email address, nor did it provide correction suggestions to solve the problem. Severity Rating (3).

## 10: Help and documentation

- There is no FAQ or any feedback entries except for the official email account. Thus, it might cause inconvenience for users who like to connect and collaborate, report errors for website improvement or to communicate with the administrators from the organization. Additionally, there is no clear indication or directory for “Contact Us” or contact forms. Severity Rating (3).

- The website does not contain a  search bar or any equivalent search function. This lack of system function causes convenience-related problems especially because the website hosts a considerable amount of articles. For example, when I used the website for the first time, I tried to search for marketing related positions/events/networks on the website. Nevertheless, due to the lack of search function/bar, I had to manually go through each page to find if there is any related information. Severity Rating (3). 

- Although the website contains an “About Page,” where the information of the executive board is listed, there is no relevant information such as contact email and job description for each director individually. Therefore, for users who aim to collaborate with users for a particular purpose, it might be confusing and difficult for them to reach out to the right people (person) in charge of the task. Severity Rating (2).
