# UX Design for Campus Organizations - UCLA

### DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Naomi Deng

Overall Motivation and Description of the Community: 

- In this assignment, I choose to focus on the undergraduate student organizations at the University of California, Los Angeles, particularly by analyzing the official websites designed for two on-campus organizations: Sociology Undergraduate Association and OutWrite Magazine. As a member who has contributed to and worked with both organizations, I have close access to both websites. Through my personal experience as a frequent-user, I recognized several flaws and imperfections in their website designs that might lead to inconvenient and inefficient use of the website, which can further affect user experience, especially for novice users. A unpleasant user experience might influence the website traffic and cause obstacles for acquiring resources and recruiting new members for the organization. Therefore, through this exercise, I aim to recognize, detect and analyze both websites following Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems. I hope to contribute to campus organizations I am associated with to help them  as well as propose potential suggestions to create an improved overall experience for future users. 

### First Website - Sociology Undergraduate Association website 

Information about the website and organization: 

- http://bruinsua.weebly.com/

- This is an official website of the Sociology Undergraduate Association at UCLA. Sociology Undergraduate Association at UCLA is an on-campus organization registered under the Sociology department with the purpose of fostering community learning in the academia of Sociology. The websites consist of 5 distinctive pages, “Home,” “About,” “Gallery,” “Blog” and “Join”. Apart from the “Gallery” page, each page is developed and displayed with different information. For example, on the “Blog” page, it shows articles written by SUA bloggers and writing contributors. Users could use the website to gain information about members on the executive board, connect with the organization through the email addresses and social media platforms listed on the website, review sociology-related articles and join the mailing list for updates. The website is hosted and managed by executive members from the association, using the platform Weebly.

sdosafhsdhhihhsidgfsdhcosndcjosidcnksdpcadkbfsldnfpdsnfsdnknfdbjngldhgflkdnglkd

## 1: Visibility of system status

- The website does not always inform users about what is going on on the website. For example, when I first opened the "Gallery" page, there is no indication of what kind of content is exhibited on the page, nor is there a loading sign of any graphic content. I waited for a few minutes to make sure that the page is empty. A solution to the problem is to have written content such as “please check with us later, the page is still under development” to inform users that the "Gallery" page is not fully updated. Severity Rating (3).

- No "page loading" indicators: when I am on the "Blog" page, the page shows 10 articles in total, whereas when loading, the website doesn’t indicate the process. Instead, it shows a black block which confuses users to understand which actions are being processed. The solution is to add a loading indication such as a percentage bar that shows the number of articles that the website is trying to load. Severity Rating (3).

## 2: Match between system and the real world 

- On the "Home" page, there’s no introduction of the organization and thus first-time users who use the website might feel lost of what they are looking at. Conventionally, when facing a new platform or using a newly purchased product, we tend to read the introduction and manual. However, on the homepage, there are only a random aesthetics picture, the title of the organization, and three buttons that link to the social media platforms of the organization (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram). Thus the page does not follow real-world conventions. Severity Rating (3).

- The “Join” page could be confusing and misleading to users. On the page, the website provides a mailing form which should be instead categorized as “Subscription” instead of “Join”. Additionally, on the top part, the website exhibits information for “Membership” which should be listed on a separate website because it serves for a different function (recruitment instead of collaboration). Severity Rating (2).

## 3: User control and freedom

- On the right top corner of the website, there is an email button. If someone accidentally clicked the email button, it links to the primary email application installed on each laptop. This causes trouble for users who click this button by mistake and the website does not provide a “undo” function. For example, I am using a Mac OS system and thus it automatically opened my “Email” application. There is no undo button that prevents the application from opening. Thus, I had to manually close my email application. Severity Rating (2).

![email icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623164/72344293-bd239f00-3685-11ea-9dc5-489e7f3b91ab.png)

- The subscription form has no "cancel" or "reset" button, which means that for users who enter the wrong information, they would have to manually delete the information instead of hitting a reset button that helps them “undo” their action. Additionally, for users who might have a second thought on submitting their contact information, there is no way to “undo” or “cancel” their submission. Severity Rating (2).

## 4: Consistency and standards

- The email button on the right top corner does not necessarily follow platform conventions. Conventionally, the contact and social media information are usually systematized together either on the header of the website or the foot bar. However, the website exhibits social media platforms through individual buttons on the homepage and separates the email button, which is positioned by itself. The email button should be exhibited using the same button design with the other social media buttons, and the home page should consist of an introduction of the organization. Severity Rating (3).

- There is a lack of “Contact Us,” “Privacy Policy” and social media icons on the foot bar. Usually, these links could be found on the bottom of the page (platform conventions). Severity Rating (2).

## 5: Error prevention

- The subscription form does not detect the errors in the email information users entered in the subscription form, and thus it does not prevent errors from occurring. This missing error prevention function could cause miscommunications and lost opportunities. For example, if a user accidentally wrote “gmail.com” and “fmail.com” and the website didn’t prevent this from happening (by a friendly warning pop-up sign or box), the organization could lose a potential member or target of interest. Severity Rating (3).

## 6: Recognition rather than recall

- When users enter the email address in the form on the "Join" page, the website fails to provide a preset of @gmail.com / @outlook.com /@yahoo.com, which could serve for email addresses recognition as well as error prevention. Severity Rating (2).

## 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

- The "Blog" page lacks individual links for each of the writing pieces and a “back to the top” option. This causes inconvenience for users who has a particular interest in a certain piece or wants to quickly go to another page. When viewing the Blog page, a user can only go through all the content listed on the page before he can choose to view another page (there are “previous” and “back” buttons provided only on the bottom of the page). Severity Rating (3). 

## 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

- The website contains a minimalist design which could be further improved by reducing irrelevant graphics and reconstructing the layout of certain pages. For example, the main visual cues used in the Blog page and the overall visual appearances consist of multiple colors, whereas on the Home page, there is a black and white picture which causes confusion and inconsistency use of hues. Additionally, the Blog page appears congested and poorly structured due to the size of the fonts used in each article and the spacing between each article. Severity Rating (1).

## 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

- Although the contact form on the "Join" page does recognize missing information, (example: there will be a reminder in case the user doesn’t provide his/her last name or email address, it explains the error in plain language as “Please correct the highlighted fields”), it does not help recognize or scrutinize errors entered manually by users in contact forms. For example, I intentionally entered an invalid email address (maggielee@jsdfksd.com), the website doesn’t not recognize the error in the email address, nor did it provide correction suggestions to solve the problem. Severity Rating (3).

## 10: Help and documentation

- Although the website contains an “About Page,” where the information of the executive board is listed, there is no relevant information such as contact email and job description for each director individually. Therefore, for users who aim to collaborate with users for a particular purpose, it might be confusing and difficult for them to reach out to the right people (person) in charge of the task. Severity Rating (2).

![SUA contact info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623164/72344854-1f30d400-3687-11ea-9043-2892d41f27d3.png)

- There is no FAQ or any feedback entries except for the official email account. Thus, it might cause inconvenience for users who like to connect and collaborate, report errors for website improvement or to communicate with the administrators from the organization. Additionally, there is no clear indication or directory for “Contact Us” or contact forms. Severity Rating (3).

- The website does not contain a search bar or any equivalent search function. This lack of system function causes convenience-related problems especially because the website hosts a considerable amount of articles. For example, when I used the website for the first time, I tried to search for marketing related positions/events/networks on the website. Nevertheless, due to the lack of search function/bar, I had to manually go through each page to find if there is any related information. Severity Rating (3). 

### Second Website - OutWrite Magazine website 

Information about the website and organization:

- https://outwritenewsmag.org/

-  This is a website of an on-campus, student-run magazine called "OutWrite". OutWrite Magazine is an online media platform that instill power in the voices of queer community by sharing original editorial content, interviews and creative writing pieces on essential issues that matter. It aims to educate allies and advance communications within the community. The website includes a home page and 9 pages that exhibit editorials in addition to original illustrations. On the website, users could review articles regarding a wide spectrum of topics such as politics and news, arts and entertainment, campus happenings and popular culture. The core functionality of the website is to offer a platform for the creative efforts of the magazine’s staff and individuals within the queer community. We aim to articulate these experiences as well as raising awareness and elevating respect for diverse identities.

Brief Initial Evaluation and Motivation: 

- At first sight, the website applies a clear (white) background with multiple colors that existed in different graphic designs and logos. The overall layout is clean, organized and well-structured. It follows a left-right-division where main content on each page is structurally formatted on the left side, with a sidebar that provides additional information on the right side. One noticeable incongruent element that appears on each page is the font size difference between the heading and sub-categories. For example, on the “Arts and Entertainment” page, the title font displayed over the bright green bar is much bigger than the four sub-categories – “Film,” “Literature,” “Music” and “TV”. When hovering over the menu bar, the words (page titles) change to different colors that are consistent with the bar behind their titles. Each page is assigned with a different color theme. (example: “Politics and News” page has an orange theme) The fonts used on the website is well-formatted and easy for users to read. Diverse and enjoyable editorial content and illustrations are shown under each page. 

- The reason (motivation) of choosing OutWrite Magazine website is because the website itself is fully developed with diverse sections, well-formatted layout and engaging content. Thus it raises a challenge for me to detect problems and to further elevate its website design. Additionally, provides an opportunity for me to use my knowledge and understanding of 10 Heuristics of Usability Design to detect the underlying problems in the website display. In addition, I could rely on my personal experience in using the website in additional to the heuristics to identify and analyze the flaws in the design to reconstruct some of the inconsistent and incongruous pages, add missing system functions, and reduce potential errors that negatively affect the user experience. Ultimately, I hope to provide potential solutions to help improve the overall design of the website to offer a more user-friendly interface for novice users, and help the website and organization gain more website traffic for brand promotion. 

## 1: Visibility of system status

- One satisfactory design: Unlike the website of Sociology Undergraduate Association, the OutWrite Magazine website provides a loading icon (circled page-loading indicator) that shows the loading process of the article. This function assures users that the page is processing and loading article or content, which further keep them informed about what is going on. Additionally, under each page, there is a menu indicator that shows which page the users is reviewing, allowing users to be informed on the progress and the number of total pages of articles exhibited on each page. 

- Nonetheless, on the “Contact” page, after users left a comment, there is no indication that the comment is being posted and processed. For example, due to the lack of indication, I left two identical comments on the page. This could be solved by adding a friendly reminder such as “your message has been successfully posted." Severity Rating (3).

## 2: Match between system and the real world 

- A fraction of the website fails to use users’ language. Under Politics and News, there is a subcategory “Miscellaneous” section which is further categorized into “ABC,” “Dear Gay Uncle Joe,” “Kink Korner,” “Lists,” “Satire” and “Uncategorized.” Among these sub-categories, “ABC,” “Dear Gay Uncle Joe,” and “Kink Korner” and “Lists” might be confusing for first-time users. This is because these topics are not vocabularies used by the majority. This problem could be solved by adding an introduction paragraph under “Miscellaneous” which help users understand the content under these sub-categories. Severity Rating (2).

![outwrite info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623164/72345206-f6f5a500-3687-11ea-8e4e-efda7c48c6e5.png)

## 3: User control and freedom

- Similar to the Sociology Undergraduate Association website analyzed above, The OutWrite magazine website does not provide an “Undo” or “Cancel” button under Contact Us page. Thus, if a user enters wrong information, or would like to change her email address entered in the system, she could only manually delete her information and re-enter. Additionally, for users who have a second thought on submitting her contact information and message to the website, there is no “undo” system function, meaning she could not cancel her message submission. Severity Rating (3).

## 4: Consistency and standards

- There is no “About” page. Instead, there is only a small fraction called “Welcome to Outwrite” on the left-hand side on the home page. Conventionally, a magazine website should have an informative “About” page that showcases the mission statement, the purpose of the platform or organization. Moreover, a magazine is also run by a team of editors and writers. Thus, there could also be a separate page consists of people who contribute to the magazine. (could be incorporated in the “About” page or separate into another page such as “About the Team”) Severity Rating (3).

- On the top of the homepage, there is a black block with “Want to see your ad here? Contact us to advertise with Outwrite.” First-time users might expect that by clicking this black block, the website takes them to a separate page for advertisement purposes or contact information of the website/magazine marketers. However, the black bar links to the homepage, which is consistent with the message it aims to convey. Severity Rating (1).

## 5: Error prevention

- The subscription form does not detect the errors in the email information users entered in the subscription form, and thus it does not prevent errors from occurring. This missing error prevention function could cause miscommunications and lost opportunities. For example, if a user accidentally wrote “gmail.com” and “fmail.com” and the website didn’t prevent this from happening (by a friendly warning pop-up sign or box), the organization could lose a potential member or target of interest. Severity Rating (3).

- There are no error prevention strategies for accidental actions provided by the website design. For example, if the user clicks the link of the Instagram account of OutWrite Magazine, the Instagram page opens at the original website. Although this could be solved by clicking on “<” or any button on the web browser (example: safari, chrome) that directs the user to the previous page, the easier way to prevent this kind of error is to redesign these social media links and make them “open link in a new tab” by default. In this way, even users accidentally click the link, they could instantly close the website instead of waiting for the previous page to reload. Severity Rating (2). 

## 6: Recognition rather than recall

- Since the website consists of a generous amount of information, articles, and other editorial content, in addition to the search function, there could also be a “recent searches” and “recent viewed pages/articles” which allows users to directly go to the articles of their interest instead of being forced to memorize the information. Severity Rating (3).

- Similar to the Sociology Undergraduate Association website, the OutWrite magazine website could also provide a preset of @gmail.com / @outlook.com /@yahoo.com, which could helpfully serve for correct email addresses recognition, improve efficiency as well as error prevention. Severity Rating (2). 

## 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

- Overall satisfactory: the website provides back to the top arrow on the bottom of each page. Therefore, users don’t need to scroll all the way up to the main menu bar in case they would like to switch pages. Although this function might be unseen by first-time users of the website, (unless they experiment in their first trial), they help speed up the interaction between frequent users. 

## 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

- Although the website has a clean background and organized layout, there still is a slightly excessive and unnecessary use of color on each page. Under different pages, the main title is highlighted with a different color bar. For example, on the “Politics and News” page the title has an orange/yellow background highlight, and on the “Community” page the title has a purple/blue background highlight bar. Considering the color of the main logo is a mildly saturated pink color (“Out” in “Outwrite Est 1979” in the header) the use of color bar under each page seems a bit extra and incongruent. One solution is to change to a monochromatic color theme based on #ea178c (the pink color used in the logo) or an analogous color theme. Severity Rating (1).

- There is repetitive information on the sidebar. Conventionally, the sidebar is for information that the website targets to get more exposure because the sidebar will appear on every page on the website. On Outwrite Magazine, the mission statement and introduction (“WELCOME TO OUTWRITE”) are displayed in the sidebar, which should be instead moved to a separate “About” page. Severity Rating (1).

## 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

- The website fails to help users recognize the errors in the email function. The website does not contain an error-recognition function in their contact forms under “Contact Us”. For example, the first time when I intended to enter my email address, instead of “gmail.com” I falsely entered “gmait.com.” The system does not have any pop-up box or friendly reminder to help me recognize or provide suggestions to recover the error. Severity Rating (3).

- Although there is a friendly reminder provided by the search bar (“No articles found matching your query”), it does not propose wording suggestions when users enter a misspelled word. For example, when I tried to use the search box on the website, I accidentally typed “Chanel” instead of “Channel” to test if the system provides potential auto-correct or keyword suggestions (such as “Do you mean ‘Channel’ ?”) Severity Rating (2).

## 10: Help and documentation

- One satisfactory design: under the “Contact Us” page, different contact information is listed for people who have different purposes. For example, the links to social media platforms of the magazine are provided for users who “Love our Magazine”; for users who are interested in contributing to the magazine, editors’ email addresses are listed under “Want to join?”

- The website does not contain a  search bar or any equivalent search function. This lack of system function causes convenience-related problems especially because the website hosts a considerable amount of articles. For example, when I used the website for the first time, I tried to search for marketing related positions/events/networks on the website. Nevertheless, due to the lack of search function/bar, I had to manually go through each page to find if there is any related information. Severity Rating (3). 

- Nevertheless, although as an online magazine website, there could also be a section targets at FAQ or “Help” which teach novice users about how to use the website, what they could expect to gain from the content. There could also be a video guide that provides help, documentation, and introduction. Severity Rating (2).
