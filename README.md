# UX Design for Community Learning - UCLA

### DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Naomi Deng

Motivation and Description of the Community: 

In this assignment, I choose to focus on the undergraduate student organizations at the University of California, Los Angeles, particularly by analyzing the official websites designed for two on-campus organizations: Sociology Undergraduate Association and OutWrite Magazine. As a member who has contributed to and worked with both organizations, I have close access to both websites. Through my personal experience as a frequent-user, I recognized several flaws and imperfections in their website designs that might lead to inconvenient and inefficient use of the website, which can further affect user experience, especially for novice users. A unpleasant user experience might influence the website traffic and cause obstacles for attracting new members for the organization. Therefore, through this exercise, I aim to recognize, detect and analyze both websites following Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems, as well as propose potential suggestions to create an improved overall experience for future users. 

The first website is the official website of Sociology Undergraduate Association at UCLA. Sociology Undergraduate Association at UCLA is an on-campus organization registered under Sociology department with a purpose of fostering community learning in the academia of Sociology. The website is hosted by executive members from the association, using the platform Weebly.

The second website is the website for an on-campus, student-run magazine called "OutWrite". OutWrite Magazine is an online media platform that instill power in the voices of queer community by sharing original editorial content, interviews and creative writing pieces on essential issues that matter. It aims to educate allies and advance communications within the community.

## 1: Visibility of system status

- The website does not always inform users about what is going on on the website. For example, when I first opened the gallery page, there is no indication of what kind of content is exhibited on the page, nor is there a loading sign of any graphic contents. I waited for a few minutes to make sure that the page is empty. A solution to the problem is to have written content such as “please check with us later, the page is still under development” to inform users that the gallery page is not fully updated. Severity Rating (3)

- No "page loading" indicators: when I am on the "Blog" page, the page shows 10 articles in total, whereas when loading, the website doesn’t indicate the process. Instead, it shows a black block which confuses users to understand which actions are being processed. The solution is to add a loading indication such as a percentage bar that shows the number of articles that the website is trying to load. Severity Rating (3)

## 2: Match between system and the real world 

- On the home page, there’s no introduction of the organization and thus first-time users who use the website might feel lost of what they are looking at. For example, on the homepage, there are only a random aesthetics picture, the title of the organization, and three buttons that link to the social media platforms of the organization (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram). Severity Rating (3)

- The “Join” page could be misleading to users. On the page, the website provides a mailing form which should be instead categorized as “Subscription” instead of “Join”. Additionally, on the top part, the website exhibits information for “Membership” which should be listed on a separate website because it serves for a different function (recruitment instead of collaboration). Severity Rating (2)

## 3: User control and freedom

```
Give the example
